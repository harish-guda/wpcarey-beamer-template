# WP Carey Beamer Template

This is a simple **Beamer** template that affiliates of the WP Carey School of Business can use for their research presentations. 

## WP Carey
This Beamer template uses the default Beamer theme with the following minor modifications:
- The color theme is set to ASU Maroon 
- A logo of WP Carey is present at the bottom right, 
- The slides prominantly feature the school colors (maroon and gold). 
- A scrolling bar to denote the progress at the bottom of the slide. 

## Other Features
I use three specific commands for calling content out (see `wpc-beamer-style`): 
- `callout`: to callout/caution a particular idea. 
- `newterm`: to highlight a term being introduced. 
- `bigquestion`: make the important questions being posed prominent.
